# python-boto3-project

This project demonstrates how to use Python and Lambda functions to automate tasks in AWS. We will create a Lambda function that triggers when a file is added to an S3 bucket and moves it to a folder with the format YYYYMMDD/filename, based on the file's creation date. Project provided by AOSNote.
